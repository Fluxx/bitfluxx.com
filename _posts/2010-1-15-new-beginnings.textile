title: New Beginnings

Back in late 2007, my girlfriend and I started a hobby web/content development company called "GLUEinteractive":http://gluei.com.  I had been doing off and on freelance development for a while and decided to make it somewhat official by creating a website, getting a business license and actually "doing it right."  We took on a few projects, some larger than others, but as we slowly got busier we determined that freelance contract work - on top of a full time job - was just too much.  We've all but since stopped doing any freelance work.

Shortly after I finished GLUEinteractive, I was introduced to Ruby by a coworker.  He gave me the pickaxe book to read, and it pretty much changed my professional life.  PHP isn't a very "inspiring" language.  It's quick to learn, very forgiving and easy to become basically proficient.  But there is no soul.  Ruby had a soul, and I liked it.

I built GLUEinteractive all myself.  CakePHP serves as the base web framework, but all the design, HTML, CSS and whatnot is all me.  I spent countless hours in Photoshop tweaking the design.  I coded up a custom user login system where one goes to log in to write/publish blog posts.  I purchased a slicehost to host it, configured apache and MySQL on the server and deployed the site via a @rsync@ command. 

Almost 4 years later, I've left PHP in my rear view mirror and consider myself a very different software engineer.  This blog is built upon the simple projects of "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll for the markup and "Compass":https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass for the CSS.  It's hosted on "Heroku":http://www.heroku.com.  What all this means is that I write my blog posts in textile and then the site is generated via Jeykll as 100% static HTML.  A simple @git push heroku@ deploys it.

That's the one thing that's stuck me about my growth as a software engineer since I did GLUEinteractive -- simplicity.
