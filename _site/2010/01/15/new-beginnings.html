  <p>Back in late 2007, my girlfriend and I started a hobby web/content development company called <a href="http://gluei.com">GLUEinteractive</a>.  I had been doing off and on freelance development for a while and decided to make it somewhat official by creating a website, getting a business license and actually &#8220;doing it right.&#8221;  We took on a few projects, some larger than others, but as we slowly got busier we determined that freelance contract work &#8211; on top of a full time job &#8211; was just too much.  We&#8217;ve all but since stopped doing any freelance work.</p>
<p>Shortly after I finished GLUEinteractive, I was introduced to Ruby by a coworker.  He gave me the pickaxe book to read, and it pretty much changed my professional life.  <span class="caps">PHP</span> isn&#8217;t a very &#8220;inspiring&#8221; language.  It&#8217;s quick to learn, very forgiving and easy to become basically proficient.  But there is no soul.  Ruby had a soul, and I liked it.</p>
<p>I built GLUEinteractive all myself.  CakePHP serves as the base web framework, but all the design, <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and whatnot is all me.  I spent countless hours in Photoshop tweaking the design.  I coded up a custom user login system where one goes to log in to write/publish blog posts.  I purchased a slicehost to host it, configured apache and MySQL on the server and deployed the site via a <code>rsync</code> command.</p>
<p>Almost 4 years later, I&#8217;ve left <span class="caps">PHP</span> in my rear view mirror and consider myself a very different software engineer.  This blog is built upon the simple projects of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> for the markup and <a href="https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass">Compass</a> for the <span class="caps">CSS</span>.  It&#8217;s hosted on <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.  What all this means is that I write my blog posts in textile and then the site is generated via Jeykll as 100% static <span class="caps">HTML</span>.  A simple <code>git push heroku</code> deploys it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the one thing that&#8217;s stuck me about my growth as a software engineer since I did GLUEinteractive &#8212; simplicity.</p>
