  <p>Back in late 2007, my girlfriend and I started a hobby web/content development company called <a href="http://gluei.com">GLUEinteractive</a>.  We had been doing off and on freelance development on the side for a while, so we decided to &#8220;make it official.&#8221;  I coded up the site all myself.  I used the CakePHP web framework backed by MySQL, but aside from the usual static &#8220;About&#8221; and &#8220;Clients&#8221; pages, I went the extra mile with a custom-created user login and blogging system  I was pretty happy with the way things turned out.</p>
<p>Shortly after I finished the GLUEinteractive website, however, I was introduced to Ruby by a coworker.  He gave me the pickaxe book to read, and I&#8217;ve never looked back.  Aside from the language being a joy to program in and teaching me a lot of very interesting and new concepts, the Ruby community is full of examples of people coming together and solving problems in an organized way.  <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a>, for example, standardized the web server interface for nearly all ruby applications.  <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a> is another good example, as is <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a> or the <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems</a> system itself.  Smart people collaborated with other smart people to create software that solves common problems.  And now all ruby developers can leverage that work.</p>
<p>Consequently, this blog is built upon the simple projects of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> for the markup and <a href="https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass">Compass</a> for the <span class="caps">CSS</span>.  It&#8217;s hosted on <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.  These are the already established best practices for static <span class="caps">HTML</span> generation, <span class="caps">CSS</span> frameworks and simple hosting.  And because of the awesome ruby community I&#8217;m able to leverage all their hard work to let me focus on blogging, and not mucking with <span class="caps">CSS</span> or Apache.</p>
<p>It sits in stark contrast to the overly complex <span class="caps">PHP</span>-based blogging solution I created for GLUEinteractive.  <span class="caps">PHP</span> is inconsistent and lacks many modern language features, which is alright &#8211; javscript has those same problem.  PHP&#8217;s biggest weakness, really, is the community of developers it creates.  The languages &#8220;that&#8217;ll do&#8221; attitude permeates its users, who never strive to do better, work together or solve the tough problems they all face.</p>
<p>Ruby was a fresh start to my software development career, so I felt it was fitting to mention it in the inaugural post of my new blog.  I&#8217;m leaving GLUEinteractive behnind and starting fresh with this blog.  Expect content about software engineering, web development and ruby, plus other topics as I find them interesting.</p>
<p>I promise to blog at least weekly, but hopefully more often.  So stay tuned!</p>
