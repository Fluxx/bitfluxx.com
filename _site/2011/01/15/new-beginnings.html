  <p>Back in late 2007, my girlfriend and I started a hobby web/content development company called <a href="http://gluei.com">GLUEinteractive</a>.  We had been doing off and on side jobs for a while, so with GLUEinteractive we decided to &#8220;make it official&#8221; and create a website for our work.</p>
<p>Shortly after I finished the website, I was introduced to Ruby by a coworker.  He gave me the <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby/programming-ruby">pickaxe book</a> to read, and I&#8217;ve never looked back.  Aside to my enjoyment of the language itself, Ruby&#8217;s community is spectacular.  It&#8217;s full of projects where Rubyists came together and solved problems in an organized way.  <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a>, for example, standardized the web server interface for nearly all Ruby applications.  <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a> is the de facto build tool for Ruby projects. <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a> made dependency resolution sane. <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems</a> itself is another great example.  Smart people collaborated with other smart people to create software that solved common problems.  And now all ruby developers can, and most importantly <em>do</em>, leverage that work.</p>
<p>Consequently, this blog is built upon some very awesome projects:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> allows me to write simple layout and view templates, my blog posts in textile and it does the boring task of generating <span class="caps">HTML</span>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass">Compass</a> is a <span class="caps">CSS</span> framework built upon <span class="caps">SASS</span>, which lets me write <span class="caps">CSS</span> in a organized and reusable <span class="caps">DSL</span>, while Compass generates the <span class="caps">CSS</span>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>, basically Ruby/Rails app hosting in the cloud, hosts this blog (currently for free).</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve all but stopped doing freelance work, but still want to blog about software development &#8211; so I felt like it was time to start anew with my own blog.  I&#8217;ll likely be moving some posts over to here and eventually decommissioning GLUEinteractive.  I promise to blog at least weekly, but hopefully more often. Expect content about software engineering, web development and ruby, plus other topics as I find them interesting.</p>
<p><em>Stay tuned!</em></p>
