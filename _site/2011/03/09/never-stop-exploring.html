    <p>After a solid 2+ years, I decided it was time to upgrade my current Macbook to a new Macbook Pro.  There wasn&#8217;t anything inherently wrong with the old laptop, other than it was&#8230;well&#8230;old, slow and had a small screen.  That, and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">new Macbook Pros</a> came out recently and I figured now was a good time to upgrade.</p>
<p>In the new Macbook, I ditched the optical drive and put in its place a 125 GB <span class="caps">SSD</span> hard disk.  The <span class="caps">SSD</span> drive is my main drive, which holds the OS and most of my working files.  The stock &#8220;spinning&#8221; drive is now tha secondary drive,  holding big files (movies, music, databases, etc). The result is that applications now load <em>blazingly</em> fast, and I have about 5-6 hours of battery life.  It&#8217;s pretty sweet.</p>
<p>With the fresh start of a new laptop, also I wanted to use it as an opportunity to try <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> instead of <a href="http://www.macports.org/">Macports</a> and <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> as opposed to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Macports, which manages packages with port files, shell scripts and <span class="caps">SVN</span>, Homebrew uses Git and Ruby.  Packages are built in a simple <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/ruby.rb">Ruby <span class="caps">DSL</span></a> and installed to <code>/usr/local</code>, self-contained in a folder with the same name as the package.  Since Homebrew recipes are held in a Git repository, you can easily commit fixes, create new packages or even checkout a revision containing the exact version of a certain package quite easily.  Oh and package installation takes mere seconds, as opposed to Macport&#8217;s 5-45 minutes.</p>
<p>zsh is a shell, like bash, but with a few enhancements.  It has a lot of functionality, but the main reason I installed it was cause of <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a>.  oh-my-zsh is a &#8220;community driven framework for managing your zsh configuration.&#8221;  The main appeal is its <a href="https://wiki.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/themes">large collection of themes</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins">plugins</a>.  There are plugins to show the version of ruby (if using <span class="caps">RVM</span>) you&#8217;re using or the current git branch you&#8217;re in at your prompt, rake task autocompletion, plus much, much more.</p>
<p>I decided to try an <span class="caps">SSD</span> drive, Homebrew and zsh on the suggestion of a couple coworkers.  It&#8217;s not that I didn&#8217;t know about both of these technologies before; it&#8217;s more that I never gave them a serious look.  Spinning disks, Macports and bash had been working alright for me, and I was comfortable with them and thus had no reason to change.</p>
<p>In actuality, however, I had plenty of reasons to change &#8211; <em>I just didn&#8217;t know it</em>.  Had I known how much time and sanity they would save me, and how much better I would be at my job, I would have made the switch sooner.</p>
<p>The moral of the story here is never be complacent as a software developer.  Never stop exploring technologies and solutions to problems.  Never be satisfied with what you have.  The software world is ever-changing, improving and expanding.  New tools come out every day focused on making your life happier and more productive.  Go out and learn about them.  The day you settle down with &#8220;Macports and spinning disks&#8221; is the day you stop growing as a programmer.</p>
