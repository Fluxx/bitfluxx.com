p(#author). !/images/me.jpg(Jeff Pollard)!

This is the blog and personal website of Jeff Pollard, a software developer currently living in Seattle, WA.  I "mostly write ruby":projects.html, but also dabble in Python and am constantly learning as much as I possibly can about writing software.  I also love music, dogs (especially mine), beer and my "wonderful girlfriend":http://allthingssimpleblog.com/.

Find me at these lovely online establishments:
