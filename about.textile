p(#author). !/images/me.jpg(Jeff Pollard)!

This is the blog and personal website of Jeff Pollard, a software developer recently transplanted to San Francisco, CA and hacking on open source and infrastructure at "DISQUS":http://disqus.com.  I "mostly write Ruby and Python":projects.html and am constantly learning as much as I possibly can about writing software.  I also love music and beer, preferably at the same time.
